## Project Overview
Bank fraud can have severe financial and reputational consequences. To mitigate these risks, we've developed a fraud detection system that uses SQL to analyze transaction data for patterns indicative of fraudulent activity. This repository contains SQL queries and scripts used to clean, preprocess, and analyze the data. The results provide insights and alerts for potentially fraudulent transactions.

**Data Source:** Kaggle
## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a critical step to ensure data quality. We've handled missing values, data transformations, and data merging to create a clean dataset ready for analysis.

## SQL Queries
This repository contains SQL queries for various aspects of the fraud detection system:
- Identification of anomalies in transaction data.
- Alert generation for suspicious activities.
- Customer profile analysis.

## Results
Our SQL-driven bank fraud detection system provides a real-time monitoring solution, enabling the bank to take immediate actions when fraudulent activities are detected. The results include alerts, detailed reports, and insights for fraud prevention.

## Getting Started
To explore and use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local environment.
2. Access the SQL scripts in the `sql` folder.
3. Run the SQL queries in your preferred SQL database management system.
4. Analyze the results and adapt the system to your specific use case.
